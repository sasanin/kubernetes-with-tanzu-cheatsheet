# Kubernetes with Tanzu Cheatsheet

## Introduction
Welcome to a place where you will hopefully speed up your work with Tanzu and Kubernetes. The intention is provide a structural approach to the Day 0-n lifecycle as for its commands as well as do's, why's and dont's. This cheatsheet will primarily focus on Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG) and Kubernetes in joint collaboration on managing modern apps in a cloud native way. The page will try to always keep the latest modern approaches to the different scenarios and commands as available per latest released versions. The content may also be a benefit if pursuing CKAD or CKA certifications.
