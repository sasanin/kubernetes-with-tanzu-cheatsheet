# Kubernetes with Tanzu Cheatsheet

## Introduction
Welcome to a place where you will hopefully speed up your work with Tanzu and Kubernetes. The intention is provide a structural approach to the Day 0-n lifecycle as for its commands as well as do's, why's and dont's. This cheatsheet will primarily focus on Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG) and Kubernetes in a joint view on managing modern apps in a cloud native way. The page will try to always keep the latest modern approaches to the different scenarios and commands as available per latest released versions.
